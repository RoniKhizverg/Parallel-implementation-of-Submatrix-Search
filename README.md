# Parallel-implementation-of-Submatrix-Search

### Problem Definition

Picture(N) and Object(N) – are square matrices of integers with N rows and N columns. Each member of the matrix represents a “color”. The range of possible colors is [1, 100].
Position(I, J) defines a coordinates of the upper left corner of the Object into Picture. 
For each pair of overlapping members p and o of the Picture and Object we will calculate a relative difference
			                                                  	diff =  abs((p – o)/p)
The total difference is defined as a sum of all relative differences for all overlapping members for given Position(I, J) of the Object into Picture. We will call it Matching(I, J).
